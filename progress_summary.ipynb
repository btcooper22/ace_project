    "\n",
    "Very few positive examples. V high variance of hospitalisation rate between different features. Transpires data only features patients that were accepted by the ace service - i.e. true / false negatives - no data on patients ACE thought werent suitable for service.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generic pandas pipeline to clean / fill nas and add engineered features:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clean data - set \"None\"s to nan and then convert numeric features to float\n",
    "and categoric features to category\n",

    "fill NA - majority missing only one feature that can easily\n",
    " be inferred from other examples.\n",

    "f1 generally around 25% / roc auc barely above .5 - very few models that are\n",
